ASL was acquired with multi-PLD 300, 600, 900, 1200, 1500, 1800, 2100, 2400, 2700, 3000 ms PASL labeling and a 3D 3Dgrase readout with the following parameters: 11.92 TE ms, TR 3500 ms,  flip angle 180 degrees, in-plane resolution 8x4 mm2, (TODO: number of slices) slices with 6 mm thickness, inversion time 300 (1.0 repetitions), 600 (1.0 repetitions), 900 (1.0 repetitions), 1200 (1.0 repetitions), 1500 (1.0 repetitions), 1800 (1.0 repetitions), 2100 (1.0 repetitions), 2400 (1.0 repetitions), 2700 (1.0 repetitions), 3000 (1.0 repetitions) ms, with bolus saturation using Q2TIPS pulse applied at 700 and 1600 ms after the labeling, with background suppression with 2 pulses at 150 and 200 ms after the start of labeling. In total, 10 control-label pairs were acquired
