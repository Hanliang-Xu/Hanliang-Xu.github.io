ASL was acquired with on a 3T Siemens Prisma_fit scanner using single-PLD PCASL labeling and a 3D GRASE readout with the following parameters: TE = 13.28ms, TR = 4950ms, flip angle 130 degrees, in-plane resolution 3.4x3.4mm2, 28 slices with 4.01mm thickness, labeling duration 1800ms, PLD 2000ms, with background suppression with 4 pulses at 2290ms, 2925ms, 3425ms, and 3705ms after the start of labeling. In total, 8 control-label pairs were acquired. M0 was acquired with the same readout and without background suppression. TR for M0 is 4.95.
