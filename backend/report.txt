REQ: ASL was acquired with single-PLD (inconsistent, 2000 is the most common data) ms PCASL labeling and a 3D 3Dgrase readout with the following parameters:

REQ: (inconsistent, 13.28 is the most common data) TE ms, TR (inconsistent, 4950 is the most common data) ms, flip angle (inconsistent, 130 is the most common data) degrees,
REQ: in-plane resolution (inconsistent, 3.4x3.4 is the most common) mm2,
REQ: (TODO: number of slices) slices with (inconsistent, 4 is the most common) mm thickness,

REQ-PCASL: labeling duration (inconsistent, 1800 is the most common data) ms,
REQ-PCASL: PLD (inconsistent, 2000 is the most common data) ((inconsistent, 8 is the most common data) repetition) ms,

REQ: (inconsistent, with is the most common) background suppression

REQ: In total, (inconsistent, 8 is the most common data) control-label pairs were acquired
