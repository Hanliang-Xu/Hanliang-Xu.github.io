ASL was acquired with multi-PLD 300, 600, 900, 1200, 1500, 1800, 2100, 2400, 2700, 3000 ms PASL labeling and a 3D GRASE readout with the following parameters: TE = 11.92 ms, TR = 3500 ms, flip angle 180 degrees, in-plane resolution 8x4 mm2, (TODO - read in NIfTI) slices with 6 mm thickness, inversion time 300 (1 repetitions), 600 (1 repetitions), 900 (1 repetitions), 1200 (1 repetitions), 1500 (1 repetitions), 1800 (1 repetitions), 2100 (1 repetitions), 2400 (1 repetitions), 2700 (1 repetitions), 3000 (1 repetitions) ms, with bolus saturation using (inconsistent, no common data) pulse applied from 700 to 1600 ms after the labeling, with background suppression with 2 pulses at 150 and 200 ms after the start of labeling. In total, 10 control-label pairs were acquired.
