In total, 48 label-control pairs were acquired. Balanced PCASL labeling was applied with the following pulse parameters: average 0.8mT/m and maximum pulse gradient 6mT/m, with 0.6ms pulses applied at 1ms intervals, with 20 degree flip angle. M0 was acquired with the same readout and without background suppression.",
