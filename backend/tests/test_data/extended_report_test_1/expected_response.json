In total, 8 control-label pairs were acquired. Balanced PCASL labeling was applied with the following pulse parameters: average 10mT/m and maximum pulse gradient 20mT/m, with 40ms pulses applied at 50ms intervals, average B1-field strength 30mT. M0 was acquired with the same readout and without background suppression.",
