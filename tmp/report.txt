ASL was acquired on a 3T Siemens Prisma_fit scanner using single-PLD PCASL labeling and a 3D EP readout with the following parameters: TE = 36.54ms, TR = 3710ms, flip angle 120 degrees, in-plane resolution 3.59375x3.59375mm2, 20 slices with 5mm thickness, labeling duration N/Ams, PLD N/A, with background suppression. In total, None control-label pairs were acquired. M0 was acquired with the same readout and without background suppression.
