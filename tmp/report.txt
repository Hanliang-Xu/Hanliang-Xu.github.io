ASL was acquired on a 3T Siemens Prisma_fit scanner using single-PLD PASL labeling and a 2D EP readout with the following parameters: TE = 14ms, TR = 3100ms, flip angle 90 degrees, in-plane resolution 3x3mm2, 20 slices with 5mm thickness, inversion time 2000ms, with bolus saturation using N/A pulse applied at 800ms after the labeling, with background suppression. In total, 42 control-label pairs were acquired. M0 was acquired with the same readout and without background suppression.
