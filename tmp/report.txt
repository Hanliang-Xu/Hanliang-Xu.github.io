ASL was acquired on a 3T Siemens Prisma_fit scanner using single-PLD PCASL labeling and a 2D EP readout with the following parameters: TE = 14ms, TR = 2540ms, flip angle 90 degrees, in-plane resolution 3x3mm2, 20 slices with 5mm thickness, labeling duration 1508.8ms, PLD N/A, with background suppression. In total, None control-label pairs were acquired. There is inconsistency in parameters between M0 and ASL scans. TR for M0 is 2000000ms.
