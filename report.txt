ASL was acquired with on a 3T Siemens Prisma scanner using single-PLD PCASL labeling and a 3D GRASE readout with the following parameters: TE = 36.76ms, TR = 2000ms (1 repeat), 4500ms (8 repeats), flip angle 120 degrees, in-plane resolution 2x2mm2, 28 slices with 2mm thickness, labeling duration 1803.2ms, PLD 2000ms, with background suppression with 2 pulses. In total, 8 control-label pairs were acquired. No m0-scan was acquired, but there doesn't always exist a control image without background suppression.
