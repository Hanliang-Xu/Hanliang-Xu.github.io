ASL was acquired with (inconsistent, single-PLD is the most common) (inconsistent, no common data) ms PCASL labeling and a (inconsistent, no common data) (inconsistent, no common data) readout with the following parameters: TE = (inconsistent, no common data) ms, TR = (inconsistent, no common data) ms, flip angle (inconsistent, no common data) degrees, in-plane resolution N/A (inconsistent, with no common data.) mm2, 40 slices with N/A (inconsistent, with no common data.) mm thickness, labeling duration (inconsistent, no common data) ms, PLD (inconsistent, no common data) ms, with background suppression with (inconsistent, no common data, Range: 2-4) pulses at (inconsistent, no common data) ms after the start of labeling. In total, (inconsistent, no common data) control-label pairs were acquired.
